# wowiebot

wowiebot is a self-hosted (meaning hosted by you, not by me) Twitch bot that you can download and use. It's easy to use and new features are being added all the time. You can use the wowiebot account, or a different account if you want!

wowiebot was developed using the framework [twitchat](https://github.com/chhopsky/twitchat) by the lovely [chhopsky](https://twitter.com/chhopsky).

## Getting Started

To use wowiebot, simply download and run the exe from the [latest release](https://github.com/scattertv/wowiebot/releases/latest). There's no install, just run the exe from anywhere. Configuration files will be created in `AppData\Local\wowiebot`.

If you wish to use the wowiebot Twitch account, leave the "Log in as wowiebot" box checked. Otherwise, if you want to run the bot as my_awesome_bot or whatever other account you own, uncheck it and click Log In. You will need to provide your Oauth2 credentials; a link is provided to a page explaining how to do so. Once logged in, type the name of the channel you wish to connect to and click Connect as `<username>`.

## Configuration

Configuration is done through the Configure menu. Several example commands are provided to demonstrate the various features of the bot, but you may delete them by clicking on the left column to select the entire row and press the Delete key. To write a new command, just start typing in the bottom row and a new row will be created. 

In the message of a bot command, placeholders can be used. There are two main types of placeholders, static and dynamic. Static placeholders simply replace the placeholder with some text; the broadcaster's name, for example. Dynamic placeholders completely change the command's meaning and may not send any message at all.

* Enabled: This is used to enable or disable a command. Disabled commands will be ignored by the bot.
* Command: Comma-separated list of keywords that will trigger the command. The first value is the one that will appear in the list of commands, if applicable.
* Message: This is the message that will be sent by the bot when the command is received. Placeholders such as $QUOTE can be used and will be replaced accordingly. Press the ? button or see below for a full list of placeholders.
* Show in commands list: This determines whether the command will be shown in the list generated by the $COMMANDS placeholder, generally seen as !help or !commands.

On the left of the Configure screen are other options that can be set in wowiebot. 

* Prefix: The character that command names must be preceded by in order to be received by the bot.
* Edit Quotes: Newline-separated list of quotes that have been added by the $ADDQUOTE command. This can be edited freely.
* Edit 8-Ball Choices: Newline-separated list of options that will be chosen from at random when the $8BALL command is used.
* Display link titles: When enabled, the bot will display the title of a web page when links are detected in chat.
* Quote adding permissions: Choose the method by which to add quotes. When the voting option is selected, a $VOTEYES command must be present or else no quotes can be added!
* Votes required to add quote (including original adder): The number of people that must agree to adding a quote for it to be added. With a value of 3, adding quotes will require 2 additional "Yes" votes.
* Message for when quotes are empty: The message that will be returned when the $QUOTE placeholder is resolved and no quotes are present in the quote list. Static placeholders can be used in this message.
* Periodic Messages: Messages to be posted by the bot periodically in the chat.
* Minimum messages between periodic messages: The number of messages that must be present in chat in between the bot sending periodic messages.
* Export/Import Settings: Allows users to quickly transfer or share bot configurations between PCs. Will save settings encoded to a json file.

### Placeholders

Static:

* $QUOTE: A random quote from the list of quotes
* $QNUM: The index of the quote selected
* $BROADCASTER: The username of the broadcaster
* $SENDER: The username of the user who sent the command
* $GAME: The game the broadcaster is currently playing
* $TITLE: The current title of the broadcaster's stream
* $UPHOURS: Whole number of hours the broadcaster has been live
* $UPMINUTES: Whole number of minutes the broadcaster has been live
* $8BALL: A random choice from the 8-Ball Choices
* $COMMANDS: A list of all commands with "Show in commands list" checked

Dynamic: 

* $ADDQUOTE: Adds a quote according to the "Quote adding permissions" setting
